Input: arr[] = [12, 34, 67, 90], k = 2
Output: 113
Explanation: Allocation can be done in following ways:
[12] and [34, 67, 90] Maximum Pages = 191
[12, 34] and [67, 90] Maximum Pages = 157
[12, 34, 67] and [90] Maximum Pages = 113.
Therefore, the minimum of these cases is 113, which is selected as the output.

Input: arr[] = [15, 17, 20], k = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: Allocation can not be done.

Input: arr[] = [22, 23, 67], k = 1
Output: 112

For Input : 12 34 67 90 2 Your Code's output is: 35 It's Correct output is: 113 Output Difference: 35 !=113
Once CHECK!!!!

/*
We want to give books to students so each student reads some books.
We try to make sure no student has too many pages.
We guess a maximum number of pages (mid).
Then we check if it's possible to give books to students without anyone getting more than mid pages.
We keep guessing smaller or bigger values until we find the best answer.

Constraints
1<= T <=50
2 <= M <= N <= 10^3
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
sum of all not more than 10^9
